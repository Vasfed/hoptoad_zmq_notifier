= Hoptoad 0MQ Notifier

Hoptoad notifier extension for speaking to the server over 0mq socket.
  
One should use this library to speak to Errbit server extended by Errbit 0MQ Handler (https://github.com/oruen/errbit_zmq_handler)

Advantage of using Hoptoad 0MQ Notifier is async notices sending. You no longer block your app flow with requests to exception handling server.
0MQ does all that stuff.

== Requirements

Ruby 1.9 or JRuby. ffi-rzmq is not working with MRI (and REE) 1.8.7.

== Installation

Install zeromq 2.1 from http://www.zeromq.org/ or your favorite package system.

Install the gem:

  gem install hoptoad_zmq_notifier

== Usage

In the same initializer you initialize your Hoptoad Notifier client:
  # Your Errbit server config. Only api_key is still relevant.
  HoptoadNotifier.configure do |config|
     config.api_key = 'ba134e3c7fab581e8685cde0a5e68728'
     config.host    = 'localhost'
     config.port    = 3000
  end
  
  # 0MQ notifier config
  HoptoadZmqNotifier.configure do |config|
    # Address to connect to send exception notifications 
    config.uri = "tcp://127.0.0.1:9998"
  end

From now all notices will be send through 0MQ socket to address you defined.
